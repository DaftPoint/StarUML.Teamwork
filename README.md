# StarUML Teamwork-Server

StarUML Teamwork-Server is an extension for the modelling tool http://staruml.io/ which provides the option to add a central repository for storing your work or Project on a git-Repository.

By installing and using this extension you can define a git-Repository to use and add Projects to it. The moment you create a new *Teamwork-Project* you can lock single elements of your project and also the whole Project. Changes made can be committed to the server without merge-conflicts because of the locks.
