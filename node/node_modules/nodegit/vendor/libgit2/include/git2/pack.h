/**
 * @file git2/pack.h
 * @brief Git pack management routines
 *
 * Packing objects
 * ---------------
 *
 * Creation of packfiles requires two steps:
 *
 * - First, insert all the objects you want to put into the packfile
 *   using `git_packbuilder_insert` and `git_packbuilder_insert_tree`.
 *   It's important to add the objects in recency order ("in the order
 *   that they are 'reachable' from head").
 *
 *   "ANY order will give you a working pack, ... [but it is] the thing
 *   that gives packs good locality. It keeps the objects close to the
 *   head (whether they are old or new, but they are _reachable_ from the
 *   head) at the head of the pack. So packs actually have absolutely
 *   _wonderful_ IO patterns." - Linus Torvalds
 *   git.git/Documentation/technical/pack-heuristics.txt
 *
 * - Second, use `git_packbuilder_write` or `git_packbuilder_foreach` to
 *   write the resulting packfile.
 *
 *   libgit2 will take care of the delta ordering and generation.
 *   `git_packbuilder_set_threads` can be used to adjust the number of
 *   threads used for the process.
 *
 * See tests-clar/pack/packbuilder.c for an example.
